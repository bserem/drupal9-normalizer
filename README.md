# Drupal 9 Normalizer

This module is heavily inspired (or copied) for [this article](https://www.mediacurrent.com/blog/using-normalizers-alter-rest-json-structure-drupal-8/)
which is quite outdated.

All it does is try to get what is discussed in the article into Drupal 9 and maybe teach a couple of things in the process.
